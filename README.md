# Sentimental-Analysis-and-product-recomendation

The project for the e-commerce company 'Ebuss' entails the development of a sentiment-based product recommendation system to enhance user experience based on past reviews and ratings. 

the tasks include data sourcing, sentiment analysis, recommendation system construction, and project deployment with a user interface.

Initially, the project involves exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and text preprocessing of a dataset containing 30,000 reviews from over 20,000 users for more than 200 products. Following this, various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Naive Bayes are trained and evaluated for sentiment classification.

Subsequently, the project focuses on building a recommendation system, selecting between user-based and item-based approaches to recommend 20 products most likely to be purchased by a user based on their ratings.

Further enhancement of recommendations is achieved by integrating the sentiment analysis model with the recommendation system, filtering the top 5 products from the initial recommendations based on sentiment analysis.

The final phase involves deploying the end-to-end project with a user interface using the Flask framework and Heroku platform. The user interface enables users to input their usernames, receive product recommendations, and view the sentiment-driven improvements.
